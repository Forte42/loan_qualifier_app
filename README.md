# Loan Application Checker

This project prompts the user to enter financial details in order to determine what loans they might qualify for.

---

## Technologies

This code was written on Windows 11 running python 3.7.13. It also uses Python Fire (version 0.4.0) and Questionary (version 1.10.0)

---

## Installation Guide

Both Fire and Questionary can be installed using the pip install function.

---

## Usage

To use this app, simply run the app in your command line and follow the questionary prompts! You will first be asked to provide a loan data set to the app. You may use the included data set I've provided or you may provide your own csv file. If you are prompted with the message:

```"Oops! Can't find this path: {csvpath}"```

Then double check that you've provided a valid path or try again. You may also receive this prompt if you provide an invalid save location at the end of this app.

Here is an example of the app in action!
